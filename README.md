# Security Groups and NACLs
Step-by-step process for **AWS Security Groups and Network ACLs (NACLs)**. This hands-on project will walk you through understanding, configuring, and testing how Security Groups and NACLs control traffic to/from AWS EC2 instances.
#
## Phase 1: Project Setup
1. Login to AWS Console
	* URL: [https://console.aws.amazon.com/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
* Use your IAM or root credentials.
2. Launch a Test EC2 Instance
	* Go to EC2 â†’ Instances â†’ Launch Instance
* Select Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu AMI.
* Choose t2.micro (Free Tier).
* In the Network Settings:
* Select default VPC or create a custom one.
* Select or create a Security Group (youâ€™ll configure it later).
* Add a key pair for SSH access.
* Launch the instance.
#
## Phase 2: Understanding and Configuring Security Groups
### A. Basics of Security Groups
* Security Groups are stateful firewalls attached to EC2 instances.
* Rules are applied to allow inbound/outbound traffic based on protocols, ports, and sources/destinations.
### B. Scenario Implementations
1. Scenario 1: Allow HTTP (80) and SSH (22) inbound, all outbound
Go to EC2 â†’ Security Groups â†’ Edit inbound rules
	* Add rules:
	* Type: HTTP | Port: 80 | Source: 0.0.0.0/0
* Type: SSH | Port: 22 | Source: your IP or 0.0.0.0/0 (for testing)
* Edit **outbound rules**:
* Allow: All traffic | Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
2. Scenario 2: Allow inbound HTTP, remove outbound rules
   * In outbound rules, remove all entries (deny all traffic by default).
   * Result: HTTP requests can be received, but EC2 cannot initiate outbound requests.
3. Scenario 3: Remove all inbound and outbound rules
* Clear all inbound and outbound rules.
* Result: All traffic is denied; the instance is completely isolated.
4. Scenario 4: No inbound rules, allow all outbound
* Remove all inbound rules (default deny).
* Set outbound: Allow All Traffic to 0.0.0.0/0.
* Result: EC2 cannot be accessed from outside but can reach the internet.
#
## Phase 3: Understanding and Configuring Network ACLs (NACLs)
### A. Basics of NACLs
* NACLs are stateless firewalls at the subnet level.
* They evaluate both inbound and outbound traffic.
* Rules are evaluated in order, from lowest to highest rule number.
### B. Examine Default NACL Settings
1. Navigate to VPC â†’ Network ACLs
2. Select the default NACL attached to the subnet your instance is in.
3. View Inbound and Outbound rules (typically allow all by default).
#
## Phase 4: NACL Rule Configurations
### Scenario 1: Modify inbound rules to allow all IPv4 traffic on all ports
* Edit Inbound Rules:
* Rule #: 100 | Type: All Traffic | Protocol: ALL | Port Range: ALL | Source: 0.0.0.0/0 | Allow
### Scenario 2: Modify outbound rules to allow all IPv4 traffic
* Edit Outbound Rules:
* Rule #: 100 | Type: All Traffic | Protocol: ALL | Port Range: ALL | Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 | Allow
### ðŸ”¸ Scenario 3: Deny all inbound traffic
* Edit Inbound Rules:
* Rule #: 100 | Type: All Traffic | Source: 0.0.0.0/0 | DENY
**Note**: Because NACLs are stateless, both directions (inbound and outbound) must be allowed for a successful communication.
#
## Phase 5: Observation and Testing
Use tools like:
* SSH Client or EC2 Connect to test SSH access.
* Use a web server like Apache or Nginx to serve a test page on HTTP port 80.
* Try using `curl`, `ping`, or web browser to simulate traffic.
* Modify the NACL and Security Group rules and observe the impact immediately.

##Summary of Key Concepts
| Component      | Type     | Scope        | Stateful | Rule Direction   | Default Behavior                     |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------ | -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Security Group | Firewall | EC2 Instance | Yes      | Inbound/Outbound | All outbound allowed, inbound denied |
| NACL           | Firewall | Subnet       | No       | Inbound/Outbound | All traffic allowed in default NACL  |
